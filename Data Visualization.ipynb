    "#### Introduction \n",
    "Regression and classification are one of the most widely used machine learning models. Even though they are on the simpler side of the model spectrum, they are used to solve problems of a higher complexity in the real world. Banking institutions and companies use regression models and their tuned versions for prediction and forecasting of the data. <br>\n",
    "Even though machine learning dates back to the 1950's with the use of statistical methods and Bayesian methods, since 2010 it has been in full throttle with the implementation of Deep learning which is said to be the future of all aspects of computing, finance, healthcare and probably almost everything. <br>\n",
    "The most important aspect of machine learning is data. A model will probably be only as good as the data it is reading and learning from. <br>\n",
    "Another important aspect of machine learning is visualization. The data that is to be represented has to be done in a way where it is easy to read, and make decisions and analysis based on it.<br>\n",
    "The following manipulations and working on the data has been done to get used to using some popular libraries with respect to data and machine learning. Visualization being the goal of this assignment, some cleaning and slicing and normal changes have been made after reading the file so that the visualization part can be done more easily. All the plots that have been generated are based on the available datasets. <br>\n",
    "Also, following datasets have been used for regression and classification visualization respectively : <br>\n",

    "####   Data for regression visualization : NYSE Stock prices for banking companies such as American Express, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan etc. https://www.kaggle.com/carusova/nyse-financial-stocks\n",
    "The motive behind choosing this data was because regression is widely used in financial companies like commercial banks, investments banks and public sector banks. Learning to study, analyzing this data with the help of exploratory techniques was the main learning goal. <br>\n",
    "This data introduces some critical terms of stock exchange such as High, Low, Open, Close,Net Change.\n",
    "There are multiple csv files for multiple companies which I have combined into one by navigating in the folder and using 'copy *.csv alltogether.csv'. This combines all samples and features into one csv file which I have used for data visualization for regression. A subset of the actual data has been used for visualizing two seperate features of two different companies.<br>"

    "For AXP (American Express), there seems to be a spike down in the stock value halfway around the data. This indicates an event that triggered the fall of the stock value. Inspection of this event, done carefully can get insights into why the event was caused and help the company to sheild the stock prices in the future in case of another such unfortunate event.<br>\n",
    "It has to be noted that the fall is not a completely straight line and hence can be inferred that the fault happened gradually. Also, the prices went up very quickly which could point to a simple technical problem in the company which got resolved quickly, still hurting the company. \n",

    "We can observe that around the 7th data point to the 13th data point there is a spike down in the stock price w.r.t the Net change value. There is a futher and even deeper spike down in the data around 20th data point. We can make certain assumptions that there was some critical reason due to which the stock price started falling and reached a low point. Further analysis can help risk management team to keep the stock price from falling in any such similar event in the future. <br>\n",
    "We can also observe that the first dip was small but lasted longer than the second one indicating a more complex issue than the second one.<br>\n",
    "On the other hand, the second dip was significantly high which could indicate a serious yet fixable problem because the value went to the normal quicker than the previous dip. <br>\n",
    "In both the dips, the slope of the dipping line is steeper than the growing line which could mean that there were some issues in resolution which could be actually inter connected to each other.\n"

    "The data, in both the cases did not need much processing because most of the values were self explanatory and contained no or very less alteration. <br>\n",
    "The primary learning goal of this assignment was achieved as popular libraries like Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib were used.<br>\n",
    "I tried to use a library called Seaborn on the TA's suggestion for visualization as Matplotlib was taking quite a while to run, but could not understand the library well and will be learning it as the course progresses.<br>\n",
    "The primary challenge was to select the features to plot but it was well understood as the primary attributes of the stock market and marketing in the banking institutions are quite well known.<br>\n",
    "In this process, some features of Jupyter Notebook like Markdown, adding and deleting cells with shortcuts, activating the autocomplete feature were also learnt which would prove to be very useful in the future.<br>\n",
    "Deducing the occurances of an event was understood, due to which there could be a minor change in the data or a spike in the data points.<br>\n",
    "Summarizing, the basics of data visualization using popular libraries was done and understood in Assignment 0.<br>"
